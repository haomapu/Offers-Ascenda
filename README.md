# Offers-Ascenda

## Notes:
This is the most knowledgeable languague that I use to build a website application.\
Use server-side render and bootstrap to display data.\
I built a simple web application to display offers because I dont know how to create unit test

## Routes
PORT 3000:\
GET: / : Get all offers.\
POST: / : Get all offers.\

PORT 8080:\
GET: /api/all : Get all offers as Restful API.\
GET: /api/filter : Get filtered offers as Restful API but Hardcode.

POST: / : Post date to get filtered API.
